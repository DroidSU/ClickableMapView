 # Clickable Map View - Android

Hey ðŸ‘‹, this project a part of [Foodmux](http://github.com/goforbg/foodmux), an upcoming food community app. 
I decided to make this open source since I didn't find anything like this when I wanted to.
This project is a cool way to make your users select their state from a map on Android.
Feel free to add other maps to the repo, with a pull request. This project wouldn't have been possible without RichPath Library.

--------------------------

Feel free to report or add any useful feature, I will be glad to improve it with your help.
The main issues right now are to:
 * Test it with old Samsung devices, 
 * Add zoom feature,
 * Need more maps.
